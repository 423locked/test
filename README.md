Test repository.

Basically the repository contains an html file with two password input tags.

The app.js file contains Vue.js code with two initialized components: pass1 and pass2.
The input tags have a property v-model on 'em. (pass1 and pass2)

And then it basically reactively checks whether the passwords match or not, and if they do not,
shows the "The passwords do not match." message.
